# responsive-utility-classes
A highly configurable SCSS/SASS generator for creating responsive utility classes. 

This is pretty much a lab trying to create something similar to Tailwind but using just SCSS/SASS. It works pretty well and is being used in real projects.

The code itself is well documented and should be preconfigured to suit many other projects, but feel free to clone the project and customize it to your preferences.
