# responsive-utility-classes
A highly configurable SCSS/SASS generator for creating responsive utility classes. 

This is pretty much a lab trying to do create something similar to Tailwind but using just SCSS/SASS. It works pretty well and is being used in real projects.

The code itself is well documented and should probably be configured to suit other projects. Clone the code and edit away to make the generated classes behave like YOU want them to look.
